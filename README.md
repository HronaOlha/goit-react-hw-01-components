## Contacts book
Add the ability to register, login and update the user, as well as work with a private collection of contacts, to the "Contact Book" program.

#### Routing
Add routing with the React Router library. The program should have several pages:

/register - public route for registering a new user with a form
/login - public login route of an existing user with a form
/contacts - a private route for working with the user's contact list
Add a Navigation component with links for navigating routes.

#### User menu
Create a UserMenu component that displays the user's mail and a logout button. Here's what its markup might look like.
```html
<div>
   <p>mango@mail.com</p>
   <button>Logout</button>
</div>
```

#### Stylization
This is the final version of the program, so work on the design of the interface. You can use a styling or component library such as Chakra UI or Material UI.
